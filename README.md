# The Video Trend Analysis Dashboard

<p>The project was developed to automate the process of analyzing trending videos on YouTube. The goal of the project is to provide the Sterling & Draper advertising agency employees with a comprehensive report and visually appealing graphs that showcase the trends in video categories, regional distribution, and popularity in the United States. The system is designed to collect data on trending videos, including their categories (such as Entertainment, Music, News & Politics, etc.), regions, and trending dates. The videos can appear in the trending section for multiple consecutive days. The project aims to provide insights into the videos that deserve marketing attention based on their popularity and category.
